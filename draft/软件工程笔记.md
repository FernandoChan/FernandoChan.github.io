1. 判断 （1.5*10=15分）
2. 选择 单选 （2*10 = 20分）
3. 填空 （2*5=10分）
4. 简答题（4道*4 = 16分） 4分  3-4句，不用太长
5. 回答题（详细点，根据分数大小来写的长度   6*2=12分  也可能是一道题） 
6. 综合题 （9分1道  3道 = 27分）

软件工程考试要素: 背

软工三要素: 过程/工具/方法

# 软件过程Process

 a series of **steps** involving activities, constrains, and resources that produce intended , 包含了系列的工具和技术

to **all** software processes: 

1. Specification
2. Design and implementation
3. Validation
4. Maintenance

软件生命期（Life cycle):

​        一个软件从定义、开发、使用和维护，直到最终被废弃，所经历的生存过程称为软件生存期或叫生命期

* 定义阶段:  制定计划, 需求分析和定义
* 开发阶段: 软件设计 , coding , testing
* 运行维护阶段

Modeling: 对过程的抽象表达

Modeling的作用:  form a common understanding , find & evaluate activities for goals , 



三个进程模型: 

* The waterfall model 

Processes activities of specification,development, validation and evolution are taken as separate process phases

* Evolutionary development

Interleave the activities ofspecification, development and validation

* Component-based software engineering

Based on the existence of  a number of reusable components

Integrating these components





## Water fall

缺点:  

1. assumes requirements can be **frozen**
2. Views software development as manufacturing process rather than as creative process
3. 无迭代no iteration leads to a final product
4. 周期长Long wait before a final product

两个变种: V model

v模型的优势: 使用左边的技巧来实现右边的功能

unit test --> procedure design
integration ---> verify architecture design
acceptance test -->  requirement



# Process Activities :  

## Software design 

a description of the structure of the software to be
implemented, the data which is part of the system, the interfaces between system components and, sometimes, the algorithms used

Design Process

## Software implementation

## The debugging process

Verification and validation (V & V) is intended to show that a system conforms to its specification and meets the requirements of the system customers

# 需求工程

人:  大公司的分析人员是一个独立的部门

Requirements engineering: the process of 

* finding out, 
* analyzing, 
* documenting 
* checking systems’ **services and constraints**

以上这些需求开发活动, 实际上是交叉递增反复的

**Requirements 和spec的区别**: 主要是范围的不同, 形式也不同

> Requirements defined **anywhwere** within the environment's domain,including the system's interface 

> Specification restricted only to the **intersection** between environment and system domain

User requirements 













Design patterns have 4 essential elements:

​	1.Pattern name: increases vocabulary of designers

​	2.Problem:intent, context, when to apply 

​	3.Solution: UML-like structure, abstract code

​	4.Consequences: results and tradeoffs



| Pattern name | Problem                 | Solution                |      |      |      |
| ------------ | :---------------------- | ----------------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
|              | incompatible interfaces | an intermediate adapter |      |      |      |
|              |                         |                         |      |      |      |
|              |                         |                         |      |      |      |
|              |                         |                         |      |      |      |
