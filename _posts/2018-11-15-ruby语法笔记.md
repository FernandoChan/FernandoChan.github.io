# Ruby 写出switch 语句

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/ruby
# -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-

x = [1,5,9]
puts x
case x
when 1..5
  puts "It's between 1 and 5"
when 6
  puts "It's 6"
when "foo", "bar"
  puts "It's either foo or bar"
when String
  puts "You passed a string"
else
  puts "You gave me #{x} -- I have no idea what to do with that."
